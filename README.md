# A homework containing 3 parts

### Part 1

In Task A, it is Large-Scale Learning. The task is traditional, I directly use ResNet-50 to solve it.

- Report training and test curves. 

- Visualize the features before the last fully-connected layer using t-SNE.

- Leverage a proper neural network visualization toolkit to visualize some conv features.



### Part 2

In Task B, it is Medium-Scale Learning. The task is traditional, I designed My-Naive-Net and beats ResNet-50.

- Report training and test curves. 

- Babysit it.



### Part 3

In Task C, I choose Task 5, that is Weakly-Supervised Learning. The task contains about 20\% wrong labels. I use pre-train to recognize the wrong labels. Then the problem becomes simple.
